Hi! My name is Audrey, and I am a junior at UNC Chapel Hill. I am double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics (B.S.). 

I first discovered how much I love to code when I took an Introduction to Computer Science class as a freshman. This led me to apply to the UNC Computer Science major, and I even became a Teaching Assistant for that very class!

Pursuing a career in data science is a natural progression of my combined passion for computer science and mathematics. I am interested in modeling, machine learning, and AI.
