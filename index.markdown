    <p>I entered university as a Psychology major, with no experience in technical fields whatsoever. I only discovered my interest in programming and mathematics when I took an Introduction to Computer Science course as a freshman. This led me to apply to the UNC Computer Science major, and I even went on to become an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for that very class.</p>

    <p>My current interests include machine learning, data modeling & analysis, generative AI, and theories of computation.</p>
