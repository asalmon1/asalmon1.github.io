    <p>I entered university as a Psychology major, with no experience in Computer Science whatsoever. I only discovered my passion when I took an Introduction to Computer Science course as a freshman. This led me to apply to the UNC Computer Science major, and I even became a Teaching Assistant for that very class.</p>

    <p>As a sophomore, I intended to apply to the Computer Science major, but applications did not open until the Spring.  At this point, I had completed most of my general education requirements, and all other computer science classes were reserved for majors. I enrolled in the courses I could: Math and statistics. During my second year in college, I took multivariable calculus, discrete math, linear algebra, data analysis, and "Introduction to Probability," a 400-level statistics class that did <b>not</b> feel introductory. Despite my difficult courseload, I enjoyed my classes, and become interested in modeling and machine learning. This inspired me to add a second major, Statistics and Analytics.</p>
