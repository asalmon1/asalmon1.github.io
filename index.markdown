I am a junior at UNC Chapel Hill, double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics (B.S.). 

I first discovered how much I love to code when I took an Introduction to Computer Science class as a freshman. This led me to apply to the UNC Computer Science major, and I even became a Teaching Assistant for that very class.

I am interested in modeling, machine learning, and AI.
